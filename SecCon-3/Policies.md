The policies enforced in SECCON 3 implement strict security configuration and controls. They can have a potentially significant impact to users or to applications, enforcing a level of security commensurate with the risks facing targeted organizations. Microsoft recommends disciplined testing and deployment using the rings methodology.

### Security Template Policies

| Feature  | Policy Setting  | Policy Value  | Description  |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| [Account Lockout](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2014/08/13/configuring-account-lockout/)  | Account lockout duration  | 15  | The number of minutes a locked-out account remains locked out before automatically becoming unlocked. |
| [Account Lockout](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2014/08/13/configuring-account-lockout/)  | Account lockout threshold  | 10  | The number of failed logon attempts that causes a user account to be locked out.  |
| [Account Lockout](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2014/08/13/configuring-account-lockout/)  | Reset account lockout counter after  | 15  | The number of minutes that must elapse after a failed logon attempt before the failed logon attempt counter is reset to 0 bad logon attempts.   |
| Password Policy  | Maximum password age  | 60  | The number of days that a password can be used before the system requires the user to change it.  |
| Password Policy  | Minimum password age  | 1  | The number of days that a password must be used before a user can change it.  |
| Security Options | Accounts: Administrator account status  | Disabled  | This security setting determines whether the local Administrator account is enabled or disabled.  |
| Security Options | Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If enabled, local accounts that are not password protected will only be able to log on at the computer's keyboard.  |
| Security Options | Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings | Enabled  | Windows Vista and later versions of Windows allow audit policy to be managed in a more precise way using audit policy subcategories. Setting audit policy at the category level will override the new subcategory audit policy feature. Group Policy only allows audit policy to be set at the category level, and existing Group Policy may override the subcategory settings of new machines as they are joined to the domain or upgraded. To allow audit policy to be managed using subcategories without requiring a change to Group Policy, there is a new registry value in Windows Vista and later versions, SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy, which prevents the application of category-level audit policy from Group Policy and from the Local Security Policy administrative tool.  |
| Security Options | Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. This setting determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member meets minimum security requirements. Specifically, it determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. If this policy is enabled, then the secure channel will not be established unless either signing or encryption of all secure channel traffic is negotiated. If this policy is disabled, then encryption and signing of all secure channel traffic is negotiated with the Domain Controller in which case the level of signing and encryption depends on the version of the Domain Controller and the settings of the following two policies:<br>- Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible)<br>- Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible)  |
| Security Options | Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether a domain member attempts to negotiate encryption for all secure channel traffic that it initiates. If enabled, the domain member will request encryption of all secure channel traffic. If the domain controller supports encryption of all secure channel traffic, then all secure channel traffic will be encrypted. Otherwise, only logon information transmitted over the secure channel will be encrypted. If this setting is disabled, then the domain member will not attempt to negotiate secure channel encryption.  |
| Security Options | Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether a domain member attempts to negotiate signing for all secure channel traffic that it initiates. If enabled, the domain member will request signing of all secure channel traffic. If the Domain Controller supports signing of all secure channel traffic, then all secure channel traffic will be signed, which ensures that it cannot be tampered with in transit.  |
| Security Options | Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior  | Lock Workstation  | This security setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader. If you click **Lock Workstation** in the **Properties** for this policy, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart cards with them, and still maintain protected sessions. For this setting to work beginning with Windows Vista, the Smart Card Removal Policy service must be started.  |
| Security Options | Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component.  |
| Security Options | Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB server component.  |
| Security Options | Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts  | Enabled  | This security setting determines what additional permissions will be granted for anonymous connections to the computer. Windows allows anonymous users to perform certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares. This is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that does not maintain a reciprocal trust. This security option allows additional restrictions to be placed on anonymous connections as follows: Enabled: Do not allow enumeration of SAM accounts. This option replaces Everyone with Authenticated Users in the security permissions for resources.  |
| Security Options | Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares  | Enabled  | This security setting determines whether anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares is allowed. Windows allows anonymous users to perform certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares. This is convenient, for example, when an administrator wants to grant access to users in a trusted domain that does not maintain a reciprocal trust. If you do not want to allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares, then enable this policy.  |
| Security Options | Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares  | Enabled  | When enabled, this security setting restricts anonymous access to shares and pipes to the settings for:<br>- Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously<br>- Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously  |
| Security Options | Network security: Allow PKU2U authentication requests to this computer to use online identities.  | Disabled  | This policy will be turned off by default on domain joined machines. This would prevent online identities from authenticating to the domain joined machine.  |
| Security Options | Network security: LDAP client signing requirements  | Negotiate signing  | This security setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of clients issuing LDAP BIND requests, as follows: Negotiate signing: If Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS\\SSL) has not been started, the LDAP BIND request is initiated with the LDAP data signing option set in addition to the options specified by the caller. If TLS\\SSL has been started, the LDAP BIND request is initiated with the options that are specified by the caller.  |
| Security Options | System objects: Strengthen default permissions of internal system objects (e.g. Symbolic Links)  | Enabled  | This security setting determines the strength of the default discretionary access control list (DACL) for objects. Active Directory maintains a global list of shared system resources, such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. In this way, objects can be located and shared among processes. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects and what permissions are granted. If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing users who are not administrators to read shared objects but not allowing these users to modify shared objects that they did not create.  |
| Security Options | User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users  | Automatically deny elevation requests | This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users. Automatically deny elevation requests: When an operation requires elevation of privilege, an access denied error message is displayed. An enterprise that is running desktops as standard user may choose this setting to reduce help desk calls.  |

| System / Device Installation / Device Installation Restrictions  | Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs  | Enabled  | This policy setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device. If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose hardware ID or compatible ID appears in a list that you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.  |
| System / Device Installation / Device Installation Restrictions  | Prevent installation of devices using drivers that match these device setup classes | Enabled  | This policy setting allows you to specify a list of device setup class globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) for device drivers that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device. If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing or updating device drivers whose device setup class GUIDs appear in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows can install and update devices as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.  |
| System / Internet Communication Management / Internet Communication settings | Turn off downloading of print drivers over HTTP  | Enabled  | This policy setting specifies whether to allow this client to download print driver packages over HTTP. To set up HTTP printing, non-inbox drivers need to be downloaded over HTTP. Note: This policy setting does not prevent the client from printing to printers on the Intranet or the Internet over HTTP. It only prohibits downloading drivers that are not already installed locally. If you enable this policy setting, print drivers cannot be downloaded over HTTP. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can download print drivers over HTTP.  |
| System / Internet Communication Management / Internet Communication settings | Turn off printing over HTTP  | Enabled  | This policy setting specifies whether to allow printing over HTTP from this client. Printing over HTTP allows a client to print to printers on the intranet as well as the Internet. Note: This policy setting affects the client side of Internet printing only. It does not prevent this computer from acting as an Internet Printing server and making its shared printers available via HTTP. If you enable this policy setting, it prevents this client from printing to Internet printers over HTTP. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can choose to print to Internet printers over HTTP. Also see the "Web-based printing" policy setting in Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Printers.  |
| System / Logon  | Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers  | Disabled  | This policy setting allows local users to be enumerated on domain-joined computers.

| System / Power Management / Sleep Settings  | Allow standby states (S1-S3) when sleeping (on battery)  | Disabled  | This policy setting manages whether Windows can use standby states when putting the computer in a sleep state. If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows uses standby states to put the computer in a sleep state. If you disable this policy setting, standby states (S1-S3) are not allowed.  |
| System / Power Management / Sleep Settings  | Allow standby states (S1-S3) when sleeping (plugged in)  | Disabled  | This policy setting manages whether Windows can use standby states when putting the computer in a sleep state. If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, Windows uses standby states to put the computer in a sleep state. If you disable this policy setting, standby states (S1-S3) are not allowed.  |
| Windows Components / BitLocker Drive Encryption / Operating System Drives  | Configure minimum PIN length for startup  | Enabled: 7  | This policy setting allows you to configure a minimum length for a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) startup PIN. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. The startup PIN must have a minimum length of 4 digits and can have a maximum length of 20 digits. If you enable this policy setting, you can require a minimum number of digits to be used when setting the startup PIN. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users can configure a startup PIN of any length between 4 and 20 digits. By default, the value is 6 digits. NOTE: If minimum PIN length is set below 6 digits, Windows will attempt to update the TPM 2.0 lockout period to be greater than the default when a PIN is changed. If successful, Windows will only reset the TPM lockout period back to default if the TPM is reset.  |
| Windows Components / BitLocker Drive Encryption / Removable Data Drives  | Deny write access to removable drives not protected by BitLocker  | Enabled  | This policy setting configures whether BitLocker protection is required for a computer to be able to write data to a removable data drive. If you enable this policy setting, all removable data drives that are not BitLocker-protected will be mounted as read-only. If the drive is protected by BitLocker, it will be mounted with read and write access. If the "Deny write access to devices configured in another organization" option is selected, only drives with identification fields matching the computer's identification fields will be given write access. When a removable data drive is accessed, it will be checked for valid identification field and allowed identification fields. These fields are defined by the "Provide the unique identifiers for your organization" policy setting. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, all removable data drives on the computer will be mounted with read and write access. Note: This policy setting can be overridden by the policy settings under User Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Removable Storage Access. If the "Removable Disks: Deny write access" policy setting is enabled, this policy setting will be ignored. |
| Windows Components / Cloud Content  | Turn off Microsoft consumer experiences  | Enabled  | This policy setting turns off experiences that help consumers make the most of their devices and Microsoft account. If you enable this policy setting, users will no longer see personalized recommendations from Microsoft and notifications about their Microsoft account. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users may see suggestions from Microsoft and notifications about their Microsoft account. Note: This setting only applies to Enterprise and Education SKUs.  |
| Windows Components / Credential User Interface  | Enumerate administrator accounts on elevation  | Disabled  | This policy setting controls whether administrator accounts are displayed when a user attempts to elevate a running application. By default, administrator accounts are not displayed when the user attempts to elevate a running application. If you enable this policy setting, all local administrator accounts on the PC will be displayed so the user can choose one and enter the correct password. If you disable this policy setting, users will always be required to type a user name and password to elevate.  |
| Windows Components / Microsoft Edge  | Configure Password Manager  | Disabled  | This policy setting lets you decide whether employees can save their passwords locally using Password Manager. By default, Password Manager is turned on. If you enable this setting, employees can use Password Manager to save their passwords locally. If you disable this setting, employees can't use Password Manager to save their passwords locally. If you don't configure this setting, employees can choose whether to use Password Manager to save their passwords locally.  |
| Windows Components / Remote Desktop Services / Remote Desktop  | Do not allow drive redirection  | Enabled  | This policy setting specifies whether to prevent the mapping of client drives in a Remote Desktop Services session (drive redirection). By default, an RD Session Host server maps client drives automatically upon connection. Mapped drives appear in the session folder tree in File Explorer or Computer in the format \<driveletter\> on \<computername\>. You can use this policy setting to override this behavior. If you enable this policy setting, client drive redirection is not allowed in Remote Desktop Services sessions and Clipboard file copy redirection is not allowed on computers running Windows Server 2003 Windows 8 and Windows XP. If you disable this policy setting, client drive redirection is always allowed. In addition, Clipboard file copy redirection is always allowed if Clipboard redirection is allowed. If you do not configure this policy setting, client drive redirection and Clipboard file copy redirection are not specified at the Group Policy level.  |
| Windows Components / RSS Feeds  | Prevent downloading of enclosures  | Enabled  | This policy setting prevents the user from having enclosures (file attachments) downloaded from a feed to the user's computer. If you enable this policy setting, the user cannot set the Feed Sync Engine to download an enclosure through the Feed property page. A developer cannot change the download setting through the Feed APIs. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can set the Feed Sync Engine to download an enclosure through the Feed property page. A developer can change the download setting through the Feed APIs.  |
| Windows Components / Search  | Allow indexing of encrypted files  | Disabled  | This policy setting allows encrypted items to be indexed. If you enable this policy setting, indexing will attempt to decrypt and index the content (access restrictions will still apply). If you disable this policy setting, the search service components (including non-Microsoft components) are expected not to index encrypted items or encrypted stores. This policy setting is not configured by default. If you do not configure this policy setting, the local setting configured through Control Panel will be used. By default, the Control Panel setting is set to not index encrypted content. When this setting is enabled or disabled, the index is rebuilt completely. Full volume encryption (such as BitLocker Drive Encryption or a non-Microsoft solution) must be used for the location of the index to maintain security for encrypted files.  |
| Windows Components / Windows Ink Workspace  | Allow Windows Ink Workspace  | On, but disallow access above lock | Allow Windows Ink Workspace  |
